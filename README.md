##Overview

Rules based permissions for the Django Rest Framework.

This framework is a perfect fit for apps that have many tables and relationships between them. It provides a framework that allows you to define, for each action or groups of actions, who has permission based on existing data in your database.

##What does DRY Rest Permissions provide?

1. A framework for defining for defining global and object level permissions per action.
  a. Support for broadly defining permissions by grouping actions into safe and unsafe types.
  b. Support for defining only global (table level) permissions or only object (row level) permissions.
  c. Support for custom list and detail actions.
2. A serializer field that will return permissions for an object to your client app. This is DRY and works with your existing permission definitions.
3. A framework for limiting list requests based on permissions
  a. Support for custom list actions
  
##Why is DRY Rest Permissions different than other DRF permission packages?

Most other DRF permissions are based on django-guardian. Django-gaurdian is an explicit approach to permissions that requires data to be saved in tables that explicitly grants permissions for certain actions. For apps that have many ways for a user to be given permission to certain actions, this approach can be very hard to maintain.

For example: you may have an app which lets you create and modify projects if you are an admin of an association that owns the project. This means that a user's permission will be granted or revoked based on many possabilities including ownership of the project transering to a different association, the user's admin status in the association changing and the user entering or leaving the association. This would need a lot of triggers that would key off of these actions and explicitly change permissions.

DRY Rest Permissions allows developers to easily describe what gives someone permission using the current data in an implicit way.

##Requirements

-  Python (2.7)
-  Django (1.7, 1.8)
-  Django REST Framework (3.0, 3.1)

##Installation

Install using ``pip``\ â€¦

    $ pip install dry-rest-permissions

##Setup

Add to INSTALLED_APPS

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
      ...
      'dry_rest_permissions',)

##Global vs. Object Permissions
DRY Rest Permissions allows you to define both global and object level permissions.

Global permissions are always checked first and define the ability of a user to take an action on an entire model. For example you can define whether a user has the ability to update any projects from the database.

Object permissions are checked if global permissions pass and define whether a user has the ability to perform a specific action on a single object. These are also known as row level permissions.

##Read/Write permissions vs. Specific Actions
DRY Rest Permissions allows you to define permissions for both the standard actions (list, retrieve, update, destroy and create) and custom actions defined using @detail_route and @list_route.

If you don't need to define permissions on that granular action level you can generalls define read or write permissions for a model. Read groups together list and retrieve, while write groups together destroy, update and create. All custom actions that use GET methods are considered read actions and all other methods are considered write.

The partial_update action is also supported, but by default is grouped with the update permission.

##Add permissions to an API

Permissions can be added to ModelViewSet based APIs.

###Add permission class to a ModelViewSet

First you must add ``DRYPermissions`` to the viewset's ``permission_classes``

    from rest_framework import viewsets
    from dry_rest_permissions.generics import DRYPermissions
    
    class ProjectViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
      permission_classes = (DRYPermissions,)
      queryset = Project.objects.all()
      serializer_class = ProjectSerializer
